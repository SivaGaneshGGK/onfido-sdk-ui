# Onfido JS SDK Migration Guide

These guides below are provided to ease the transition of existing applications using the Onfido SDK from one version to another that introduces breaking API changes.

## `1.1.0` -> `2.0.0`

### Breaking changes

- Removed `onDocumentCapture` that used to be fired when the document had been successfully captured, confirmed by the user and uploaded to the Onfido API
- Removed `onFaceCapture` callbacks that used to be fired when the face has beed successfully captured, confirmed by the user and uploaded to the Onfido API.
- Removed `getCaptures` function that used to return the document and face files captured during the flow.
- Changed the behaviour of `onComplete` callback. It used to return an object that contained all captures, now it doesn't return any data.

### Example of old behaviour

```js
Onfido.init({
  token: 'YOUR_JWT_TOKEN',
  containerId: 'onfido-mount',
  onDocumentCapture: function(data) {
    /*callback for when the*/ console.log("document has been captured successfully", data)
  },
  onFaceCapture: function(data) {
    /*callback for when the*/ console.log("face capture was successful", data)
  },
  onComplete: function(capturesHash) {
    console.log("everything is complete")
    // data returned by the onComplete callback including the document and face files captured during the flow
    console.log(capturesHash)
    // function that used to return the document and face files captured during the flow.
    console.log(Onfido.getCaptures())
  }
})
```

### Example of new behaviour

```js
Onfido.init({
  // the JWT token that you generated earlier on
  token: 'YOUR_JWT_TOKEN',
  // id of the element you want to mount the component on
  containerId: 'onfido-mount',
  onComplete: function() {
    console.log("everything is complete")
    // You can now trigger your backend to start a new check
  }
})
```
